	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">FOUNDED 1987</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">With years of experience working for his father in the accessory import business, Mark Moussa founds Arteriors Imports in November and secures a showroom in High Point for the 1988 April Market. Those first orders were handwritten but it was a start.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">THE BEGINNING</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-value">Launched with a focus on traditional accessories in classic material, Arteriors begins its transformation from a three-person accessory company to a global leader, offering sophisticated artisan lighting, furniture, wall decor, and decorative accessories.
	As the driving force behind the brand, founder and creative director Mark Moussa’s vision and keen eye for style and trends set the company on a path to expansion and success nearly 30 years ago. As the quintessential style maker, Moussa has turned his dream of Arteriors into a reality, with the company now operating in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific and the Americas.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">1995 - Arteriors Introduces The Tanner Collection.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Named after Mark’s son Tanner, Arteriors introduces its first portable lighting venture.
	“Arteriors never intended to be a lighting company, but our customers liked our accessories so much, they wanted to turn them into lamps,” says Mark when discussing the company’s first lighting endeavor. “So we did the obvious and started wiring our own lamps. We named that first lamp division after my son Tanner.”</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">1999 - The Kenzie Division</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">The Tanner Collection is followed by the creation of a more casual lamp company in 1999. The new division, Kenzie, is named for Mark’s daughter, Mackenzie. When a then nine-year-old wanted her name on something…like Tanner had. With the Kenzie division, Arteriors begins to focus on more transitional and fashion forward styling. To this day, Arteriors’ lighting divisions are still officially titled Tanner and Kenzie.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">2001 - The Premiere Catalog</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Arteriors releases its first printed catalog in January 2001. Today, the annual catalog is more than 400 pages long, taking months to produce. The catalog is mailed directly to thousands of customers each year.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">2003 - Reinvention</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">As Mark’s taste evolves, so too does Arteriors’ product line. In only six months, Arteriors’ showrooms, collateral and advertising are all updated to match the company’s new product designs.</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-value">Arteriors expands its lighting offerings to include chandeliers and pendants, inspired European antiques and mid-century modern classics.

<?php if (strtolower($brand)==strtolower("CANARM")) { ?>

	<div class="dl-brand-title-heading">CANARM</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">A BRIEF HISTORY</div>   

	<div class="dl-brand-value">Headquartered in Brockville, Ontario, Canarm is structured around its three business units – consumer products, commercial HVAC products and agricultural products.  We are privately owned and operated, and we proudly employ over 300 full-time employees.<br>
	We began as Danor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., a small sheet metal shop in Gorrie, Ontario. In 1963, the operation was moved to Brockville, where a new three thousand square foot factory was built on a WWII training artillery range on Parkedale Avenue - the site of today's corporate offices. Danor made agricultural metal products such as hog troughs and turkey feeders.</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-value">The electrification of rural Canada in the late 1950's and early 1960's changed livestock farming. Pigs and chickens no longer ran loose in the field but were confined to large barns. The need to remove gases, odours and heat from these barns led Danor to add barn exhaust fans to its product line.</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-value">Agricultural markets were not regulated in the mid-60's and a boom-bust cycle resulted. In one of these down cycles in 1969, Danor felt they should diversify their fan market to include commercial and industrial concerns. During the process of trying to break into this new market, one of our suppliers suggested we look at acquiring a Montreal company, Canadian Armature Works Corp. This long established (1934) business had electrical products ranging from fans and heaters to compact kitchens and hose dryers.</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-value">A deal was struck whereby Danor would buy their operating assets and lease their old three-story, 110,000 square foot facility. Shortly thereafter, we decided that the Montreal facility and the Brockville facility should be combined under one roof. Truckloads of machinery were transferred from Montreal to Brockville during the height of the 1970 FLQ crisis. Many product lines were discontinued in an effort to squeeze into one location.</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-value">In 1973, the formation of an Arab oil cartel quadrupled energy prices, and energy conservation and efficiency became a high priority. Many of our customers asked if we had the slow moving ceiling fans that pushed the hot air gathered at the ceiling back to floor level. Manufacturers of three-metal-blade, 56” ceiling fans were found in Hong Kong and we started importing industrial ceiling fans in 1975. A good and growing market was developed for these fans throughout the late 1970's.</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-value">However, by 1981, prime interest rates had spiked to 22% and very few commercial concerns were buying. The Far East manufacturers had plenty of excess capacity and were desperate to sell product. By replacing the metal blades with wooden blades and painting the fan brown, a more decorative look opened new markets for ceiling fans. With restaurants and homes our targeted end users, we had to develop retail chains and lighting showrooms as our customers. Ceiling fans usually replaced an existing light fixture in the home so most fans sold at retail included a light kit. We started to match other lighting products to complement the ceiling fan light kit.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Canarm Ltd. was created in 1980 by the merger of Danor and Canadian Armature Works. In 1986, Canarm purchased a Montreal ceiling fan Company and their facility became our main distribution centre for imported products. It also provided us with a local Quebec sales office and showroom. In 1990 we entered the Retail Lighting market, and we now have one of the most extensive lighting lines in North America.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">We have built our business relationships in China over the past 25 years. All operations are centralized in Zhongshan China. Our team of professionals manages our engineering, quality and logistics. The infrastructure in China ensures outstanding, consistent quality with on time delivery, whether it be single or multiple sku's per container.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">We are honoured to have been chosen as one of “Canada's Best Managed Companies” for 2012, an award given to companies who have demonstrated excellence in customer service, employee relations, supplier relations, growth, and other criteria established by an independent adjudication body. Canarm was previously recognized in 2002, 2003 and 2004.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">A growth strategy formulated in 2003 led to a series of mergers and acquisitions over the next several years. In April, 2004, Canarm acquired the assets of Florida Lighting Inc., a Toronto-based manufacturer of decorative and functional fluorescent lighting products. This acquisition launched what is now a fully developed line of fluorescent products that are sold into the consumer and industrial markets.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">In January, 2005, Canarm merged with BSM Agri Ltd., a manufacturer of livestock confinement equipment based in Arthur, Ontario. This merger significantly broadened the agricultural product offering and the newly acquired product line became a fitting complement to Canarm's existing agricultural ventilation package.<br>
	In May, 2005, the Company acquired the shares of Leader Fan Industries, a manufacturer of commercial &amp; industrial ventilation products based in Toronto. This acquisition broadened our product offering into the commercial market and provided a key distribution point for sales into Western Ontario.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">In January, 2006, Canarm acquired the shares of Farmweld Inc., a livestock confinement equipment manufacturer based in Teutopolis, Illinois. This acquisition strengthened Canarm's strategic position in the US hog market and provided additional manufacturing resources to support growing customer demand in North America and abroad.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">In June, 2006, Canarm announced an upcoming merger with Delhi Industries, a leading provider of axial fans, blowers, heat exchangers, roof exhausters, and other equipment servicing the HVAC marketplace. Delhi has two manufacturing plants in Delhi, Ontario, and one in Brantford, Ontario. As with the acquisition of Leader Fan Industries, this merger with Delhi Industries greatly strengthens Canarm's position in the commercial/industrial market sector, a key objective in becoming a significant vendor into each of the consumer, commercial, and agricultural markets.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">In 2008, Canarm acquired Titus Lighting. Titus was successful in contemporary crystal fixtures. This additon to Canarm brought a more diverse product offering in residential lighting.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Also in 2008, our 110,000 square foot distribution centre in Laval, Quebec was built. This allowed all of our consumer products to be consolidated into one location.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">An Epicor system was installed in the Brockville facility in 2009 and rolled out over the next few years to our other locations.  This technology tied together our manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide allowing all of our locations to access accurate and timely information anywhere across the globe.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Canarm added a 40,000 square foot of manufacturing space to its Brockville facility in 2011.  The Brockville manufacturing facility is a centre of excellence for HVAC products, primarily fans, blowers and air handling equipment.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Canarm has had a long relationship with the Far East, developing our contacts in mid 1970’s, well before most North American manufacturers. Several plants in China produce only Canarm products thus tightly aligning the interests of the factory and Canarm. </div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Our company is built around the philosophy of supporting our quality products with outstanding customer service. We work tirelessly to earn and then maintain our position as supplier of choice for our customers.
	If you have any questions about our company or our products, we'd be happy to hear from you.</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">Our Founder</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-value">DAVID LITTMAN IS A MAN OF UNBOUND ENERGY. While he keeps an open door to his office, you likely won't find him sitting still behind a desk. As a hands-on participant in all aspects of production, finding David in Hudson Valley Lighting's Upstate New York facility is no simple task. Perhaps he's picked up a pencil to work out his latest inspiration in our design studio. Or maybe he is on the factory floor to inspect merchandise and ensure its superior fit and finish. Otherwise, you may catch him on a conference call, helping one of our global sales representatives to meet the worldwide demand for our beautiful, high quality home lighting products. As Founder and President of Hudson Valley Lighting, David possesses an infectious exuberance for his work that belies his nearly thirty-five years in the lighting business. </div>
	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">A Lighting Family</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-value">David's history in lighting actually dates back many years before his own birth. In 1939, William Littman, a Brooklyn-based inventor and David's grandfather, was greatly inspired by the fluorescent lighting introduced to the mainstream building industry at the New York World's Fair. By 1947, what began as a garage-based business had grown substantially and the Littman family moved upstate to expand operations in the Hudson River Valley. David's own apprenticeship to the lighting industry began when he was in high school and started working in the warehouse of his father's commercial lighting factory. Though David soon moved to Boston to attend BU and earn a Bachelor's in Accounting, he returned each summer to resume duties in the family business. After graduating from George Washington in 1985 with an MBA in finance, David decided to come home and build his career in Orange County. At only twenty-three, David took the helm of his own business in the Newburgh, NY location where Hudson Valley Lighting continued to reside for the next three decades before moving to Wappingers Falls. While bright enthusiasm for today's Hudson Valley Lighting is the mark of David's kinetic leadership, he becomes reflective when asked about his thirty-three year tenure as HVL's principal and the experiences that have brought his company industry recognition as leader in style and quality. "I was always an aesthetic person," David recalls; "My mother had a passion for antiques and I was thrilled to be her partner in these 'treasure hunts.' Helping build her collection gave me an appreciation for beautiful things—for how beauty can transform your experience of the everyday." </div>
	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">A Thing of Beauty</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-value">However, David learned an early lesson in matching the outward beauty of an object to its inner strength. He recounts a meeting with an important buyer, who was initially impressed by the appearance of his designs. The buyer was interested in purchasing a large quantity of product to be sold under the name of a respected retailer; however, when she had the opportunity to handle a fixture in person, she disappointedly remarked, "It looks great, but it doesn't feel great." David immediately understood that he had neglected an important tenet of the aesthetic education he received as a young boy: "It's not enough for an object to look great; it must be made to last for future generations to appreciate it." Since that moment, David shifted from focusing strictly on the visual impact of design to what he describes as "the out-of-box experience," or the sense of quality evident when a superbly manufactured fixture is held and subjected to close, tactile scrutiny.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">"Hudson Valley is about more than lighting; it's about a lifestyle," insists David with missionary zeal. "We design and build beautiful fixtures for people who put quality first—for people who are not willing to trade-off that increasingly rare characteristic." He elaborates: "Our aim is to make a space look absolutely incredible; therefore, our first goal is always to deliver the very best fixture we can. Of course, we can only achieve that goal if we keep our products within reach of customers who understand the lasting value of a well-made fixture, but cannot simply disregard price entirely." At this, David smiles. After thirty-three years, he knows that quality, beauty, and value are more than goals; they are what Hudson Valley Lighting does better than anyone else in the business.</div>

	</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">1. The Early Years</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">DVI Lighting was founded in 1968 by Adam Altenberg, a holocaust survivor who brought his family to Montreal from war-ravaged Europe.<br>
	At the time, the company was called Dominion Ventures and it sold lighting parts to the many lighting manufacturers in the Montreal area. Operating out of a small warehouse, the company specialized in selling the components necessary to make a light rather than the complete lighting fixture. Dominion Ventures was developing an expertise of knowing lighting "from the inside out" and offered a complete, North American made line of parts to offer to the trade. At the time, most Canadian homes were decorated with Canadian-made lighting produced by relatively small manufacturers, and Montreal was the centre of the home furnishing industry in Canada.<br>
	By the mid-1970, The FLQ crisis and the increased flow of immigrants to Toronto both impacted on the emergence of a home furnishings industry outside of Montreal. Toronto had become the new manufacturing centre of Canada and so Dominion Ventures rented a small warehouse in a run-down section of downtown Toronto at John and Adelaide Streets.<br>
	Adam Altenberg, now joined by Sam Wineberg and David Elman, operated the same business out of the Montreal and Toronto locations through the 1970's and 80's. Adding new capabilities on over the years, Dominion Ventures retained a brisk business servicing the lighting manufacturers in Toronto, Montreal and even a few in Manitoba and Western Canada.</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">2. NAFTA and China</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">If you were to look at the lighting industry in Canada in 1994, very little had changed from when Adam Altenberg had started the business in 1968. Canadian consumers still bought lights made predominantly in Canada, from small lighting retailers, including the Living Lighting and Lighting Unlimited franchises across the country, and from department stores like Eaton's, Simpson's and The Bay.<br>
	However, two major changes were occurring. The NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) and far Eastern manufacturing were both changing Canadian consumer tastes as well as stripping the small Canadian manufacturers and retailers of the protection they had previously enjoyed.<br>
	In late 1980's, there were over 300 lighting showrooms in Canada. In 2012, there are less than 150 still in business. In the late 80's and early 90's the first "Big box" stores emerged in Canada with Aikenheads, Kent Building Supplies, REVY and RONA, and later with the arrival of Home Depot, and Lowe's from the US. In 1996, there were only 35 big box stores in Canada, mostly in the big cities. By 2006 there were over 150 and by 2012 there were over 300 all across the country.<br>
	The product offered in the big box stores fundamentally changed what Canadians were buying. Ignoring the small Canadian manufacturers, the big box stores took early advantage of access to overseas production and began to offer product to the consumer at roughly half the price of the small lighting retailers. Faced with the pressures of competing with cheap Chinese imports in the box stores, more than half of the lighting showroom's in Canada closed down, which in turn devastated Canadian lighting manufacturers. As well, thanks to NAFTA, retailers were now able to buy product from south of the border, and American lighting giants such as Quoizel, Murray Feiss and Schonbek became more affordable to Canadian homeowners, much to the dismay of premier Canadian lighting companies like Scorpio, Lampada and S. Thau, who all collapsed against the combined onslaught of American competition and offshore imports.<br>
	The collapse of the Canadian lighting manufacturers and the fundamental shift in the lighting business forced Dominion Ventures to adapt its business or die. The lighting parts which Dominion supplied lighting manufacturers for over three decades had been coming from North American manufacturers, creating jobs here in North America. Lamp sockets from Leviton, lamp harps from Angel Harp and cords from Cords Canada all became unnecessary with the collapse of the Canadian manufacturing network against far-eastern imports. Dominion Ventures was forced to adapt. First from the Philippines and Korea, then from Taiwan and finally from China, buying lamp parts overseas had taught the owners of Dominion Ventures about offshore production. Now under the leadership of David Elman and Sam Wineberg the company had to cease functioning as a lighting parts supplier and in order to survive started to design its own fixtures and use its relationships in China in order to adapt itself from a parts supplier into a fixture company.</div>
	 <div class="dl-brand-new-heading">3. First Steps as a Residential Lighting Distributor</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">In 1997, Dominion Ventures changed its name to DVI Lighting in order to reflect its new persona as a distributor of lighting. At first, chandeliers were manufactured in Canada, but it became quickly apparent to owners Sam Wineberg and David Elman that manufacturing in Canada was unrealistic given the price points of lighting being sold in the marketplace. To survive production had to move offshore, and slowly, the DVI line became a line of imported designs developed in Chinese factories.<br>
	Training the Chinese manufacturer's that quality had to take priority over mass production was an endemic problem then as it is now, but as the relationships strengthened between the Canadian designers and the Chinese manufacturers a harmonious relationship developed which still continues to this day. DVI's first home grown designs hit the market in 1999, blending fashionable design with pricing competitive to mass produced imports. This earned DVI a firm place in the marketplace and allowed it to become a primary lighting supplier to retailers in the Greater Toronto Area for residential lighting.  </div>
	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">4. Residential Lighting Industry Leader</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">In 2003, Robert Borg became Creative Director of DVI Lighting. With hands on experience in handling the complexities of integrated operations between North American and overseas operations, and committed under his leadership to an aggressive program of annual design cycles keeping pace with fashion changes and consumer tastes, during the 2000's DVI underwent an exponential growth phase. The company invested heavily in marketing its product to design media through product placement in television and print, thereby exposing the public to its product directly and attempted to create brand-name recognition of the DVI brand to the homeowner directly. This led to increased retail demand for DVI product and made the line extremely important for lighting showrooms across North America to showcase the DVI line in their showrooms to satisfy public demand.<br>
	Slowly, DVI expanded beyond its base of operations in Toronto and began to expand its market presence. Ignoring the big-box market and the poor quality, low-price mentality they operated under, DVI sought out relationships with premier lighting retailers, who were beginning to bounce back from the losses suffered when the big box stores attempted to destroy the industry but failed. First pushing into its historical home base in Quebec, and then expanding into the booming marketplaces in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, by the mid-2000's DVI had become one of the major players in the Canadian residential lighting market.<br>
	By 2007, DVI had become secure enough to begin to explore entry in the American market. This was no simple task, as the US market for residential lighting was in frenzy during the last days of the real estate boom. Product could not be made or delivered fast enough to satisfy the pinnacle of the booming real estate market at the time. Fortunately for DVI, little progress had been made before the great recession hit the US in late 2008 and the home furnishings industry in the US went overnight from boom to bust and suffered through three of the worst years in its history.<br>
	2009-2011 has proved to be a daunting environment for growth in the US marketplace, but it actually proved to be a beneficial environment for DVI entering a very competitive arena. Fortunately, the great recession largely skipped over Canada. Because of that, DVI was able to continue to maintain its business model, and in fact continued to grow; emphasising the regular development of fashionable designs, maintaining a look that offered a greater perceived value that its purchase price so the consumer viewed the product as "better than its price tag", and committed to maintaining a large inventory that ensured the product was available to the consumer when they needed it. These commitments were the cornerstones of DVI's success in penetrating the Canadian market.<br>
	We think that Design, Value and Inventory are a winning formula. In fact, we named ourselves after those principles. By offering the same business model to American retailers, at a time when US competitors were pulling back on new product releases and inventory management due to the pressures of the troubled economy, DVI has been able to penetrate the US market and offer the same model of Design, Value, and Inventory that American customers has made us successful in the Canadian market.</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">5. DVI Today</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">Mission</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">We are passionately devoted to creating fine artistic lighting and innovative studio glass that become the defining features of uniquely designed environments.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">History</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Lamps and objects to contain light sources are among the earliest design efforts, meeting a universal need with the human instinct to beautify and decorate. Every age from prehistoric times has left behind its decorative lamps, torchieres, or lanterns made to burn oil, wood, or wax, usually the work of individual craftsmen working in clay, metal, glass, or stone. When our company started, the name Fine Art Lamps was chosen to highlight a dedication to lighting design as an art form and an ancient tradition that would again be practiced by creative designers, artisans, and craftsmen.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">  Max Blumberg began his glass-making factory in the late 19th century, and by 1940 his son Jack founded Fine Art Lamps. He endeavored to gather the finest designers, sculptors, artisans, and decorative artists, many of whose talents had roots in the ancient crafts of Italy where they were born. From the beginning, Fine Art Lamps has been a design leader, creating true works of art – innovative designs, beautifully crafted forms of metal, glass, and unique materials with exquisite finishes. In the process, the company developed an artistic standard that has come to symbolize the Fine Lamps name today.  </div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Since 1965 Jack’s son Max has carried on the commitment of his grandfather and father to design excellence and superb workmanship. In 1976, the company moved to Miami and expanded to a state-of-the-art 300,000 square foot facility. Fine Art Lamps is proud of its pledge to manufacture in the United States of America, based on the belief that this insures design integrity, quality control, reliable delivery, and personal service. Today there are Fine Art Lamps galleries in over seventy countries around the globe.  </div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Fine Art Lamps has been honored with numerous design awards, including the prestigious ARTS® Manufacturer of the Year Award an unprecedented nine times, and the company was the first to be inducted into the ARTS®Hall of Fame. Our unique designs are copyrighted and protected by several patents. Today our devoted team of in-house design and development specialists continue to explore new concepts. But the past is always present: Fine Art Lamps’ collections from the 1940s and 50s have been shown around the country in museum retrospectives of the best decorative products of the era, and all our new designs continue to uphold the company’s original mission.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">Quality &amp; Craftsmanship: Inspired By Excellence</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Beauty is nothing without quality — and for more than a century, Fine Art Lamps has adhered to the highest standards of craftsmanship and durability to provide a product worthy of our customers’ confidence. All principal design components are manufactured in-house, from glass-blowing to metalwork, under the supervision of the industry’s foremost craftsmen and engineers. And before leaving our facilities, each piece is pre-assembled and rigorously tested by Fine Art Lamps’ stringent quality control process. In all, Fine Art Lamps represents the singular vision of over 250 skilled designers, craftsmen, artists, and associates, working together to create unique works of art – a blend of Old World tradition melded with New World innovation.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">Finishes &amp; Customization: Inspired By Details</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Exquisite finishes are the trademark of all Fine Art Lamps collections; many of the finishes require dozens of steps and applications to achieve the desired effect. Each piece is handcrafted with a unique finishing process, making it a one-of-a-kind work of art. Through our exclusive Customization Program, many of our products can be tailored to create your very own work of art. The Program allows you to select the finish, choose the shade type and make body design modifications. Our Customization Program offers added range and flexibility to enhance the décor and environments of discerning Fine Art Lamps’ owners around the world ensuring that the human instinct to beautify and decorate will be satisfied once again.</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-new-heading">ABOUT US</div>
	 
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Satco products and Nuvo lighting—a short history</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-value">Founded in 1966, Satco is well known as the premier supplier of a variety of lighting products. The SATCO brand of light bulbs, electrical accessories, lighting hardware and glassware are primarily sold through its 8,000 retail lighting showrooms and electrical distributors.</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-value">The Satco organization is privately owned and operated with warehouse distribution and sales locations in New York, Miami, Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle and San Juan, Puerto Rico totaling 1.2 million square feet. And, there are Satco Express (stocking sales-agent) locations in Charlotte, North Carolina, Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee, St. Louis, Missouri, Los Angeles, California and Portland, Oregon. It’s no wonder Satco’s inventories and distribution networks are legendary in the industry.</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-value">Under the Satco brand, the company’s product categories include incandescent, halogen, fluorescent, HID, and LED lamps as well as hundreds of styles of builder-oriented lighting fixtures, track lighting and lamps through its showroom and electrical distributor channels. In addition, Satco offers lighting and electrical components for the retail, commercial and manufacturing trade as well as consumer products such as night lights, desk lamps and surge protectors. Satco maintains an unsurpassed understanding of the lighting industry. In fact, our experience spans 4 generations, dating back to the original Edison factory!<br>
	With the company’s deep understanding of the lighting industry and after three years of development, Satco launched a new division on June 23, 2005 – Nuvo Lighting. The company’s first introductions were featured in a 242 page catalog where more than 1500 new items were presented.</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-value">Aware of the competitive marketplace that exists in the lighting industry, Satco recognized that Nuvo Lighting needed to be more than a quality offering of well-designed lighting fixtures; a 350,000 square-foot central distribution center was purchased in Dallas, Texas for the Nuvo line. And, one of the industry’s most extensive R&amp;D programs has been dedicated to developing the latest in LED technology for new high-efficiency lines of Nuvo luminaires.<br>
	Together with the sales and distribution resources of Satco Products, the continued offering of finely conceived, well-crafted products, and almost 700 Energy Star qualified products, the Nuvo brand has become synonymous with quality lighting fixtures, and has quickly become an industry leader.</div>

	<div class="dl-brand-value">It’s not like Satco to leave out a part of the lighitng industry. To address another important part of the industry, Satco acquired the Hygrade brand in late 2008. Hygrade boasts an array of high-demand products for the commercial lighting industry offering both high standards of performance and energy efficiency. Made with low levels of mercury, Hygrade lamps are designed to pass the Federal Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP). These lamps are also manufactured to meet the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and classified “lead-free”. This most recent Satco line provides lighting solutions to meet the green building and energy reduction needs of the construction and maintenance industries.<br>
	It’s no wonder Satco was awarded “The Best of the Test” by the Good Housekeeping Research Institute in 2008, and was named a 2009 “Energy Partner of the Year” in the lighting manufacturing category.</div>

<?php if (strtolower($brand)==strtolower("SAVOY HOUSE")) { ?>

	<div class="dl-brand-title-heading">SAVOY HOUSE</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Savoy House is enriched by our family-owned, Atlanta-born history and just keeps getting better more than 50 years after our founding.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">It all began with a field in the farmlands of South Georgia back in the 1930s. A young man named Robert Lee was plowing when he saw a train in the distance and thought that pretty much anything else would be better than plowing a field in the hot sun. So, he hopped on the train, carrying with him nothing but the clothes he had on and a little pocket change. He rode north to East Point and hit Main Street, where he then spent that pocket change on bread and cookies, now having nothing but hope as he looked for a better future in Atlanta.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">His gamble paid off: he and his son Fred established Progressive Lighting together in 1965. At that time, the two Lees were homebuilders who noticed that Atlanta’s lighting showrooms had unimpressive selections and weren’t good with providing lights to job sites. So, they began Progressive Lighting in that spot in East Point that once held a grocery store, starting out with some homemade shelving in the warehouse, a showroom and a counter to sell electrical supplies. It was a runaway success.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Robert also decided to start importing lighting fixtures and assembling them in the back of the shop. This also went well, so the old bakery next door became an assembly plant and warehouse. That blossomed into a catalog and a network of sales representatives who helped sell the fixtures throughout the Southeast and then the nation. Thus, Savoy House was born.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Over the past several years, Savoy House designs have evolved from a very Southern, “Gone with the Wind” traditional identity to a much broader array of styles, including soft contemporary, urban structural and nostalgic restoration looks. These fashion-forward looks have made Savoy House lighting extremely popular among design conscious professionals in the industry today.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Savoy House also carries products created by top designers, including Karyl Pierce Paxton, Tracy Porter and Raymond Waites. Pierce Paxton is inspired by New Orleans, Porter loves laid-back whimsy and Waites has an eye for elegance.</div>
	<div class="dl-brand-value">Whether you love the cutting edge of modern lighting or enjoy the enduring glamor of traditional styles, Savoy House has something great for you. Our passion for great design is coupled with a drive for quality engineering and production standards. When you choose a Savoy House lighting fixture, you can be certain you've selected a piece that will withstand the test of time.</div>
